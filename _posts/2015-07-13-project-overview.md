blurb: "VoterVOX is part smartphone app, part volunteer work, and 100% civic-minded. It’s designed to empower millions of Asian Pacific Americans who aren’t exercising their rights to vote because they are more confident in their native language and aren’t protected by the Voting Rights Act. The VRA only protects voters in districts with large numbers of speakers of a single language. No large numbers? No legal requirement to translate voting materials, which means no access to your rights if you aren't literate in and comfortable speaking English. And because Asian Americans don't speak one big language called 'Asian,' our fastest-growing communities face massive barriers to their right to vote. And democracy should be be accessible in every language."

VoterVOX is part smartphone app, part volunteer work, and 100% civic-minded. It’s designed to empower millions of Asian Pacific Americans who aren’t exercising their rights to vote because they are more confident in their native language and aren’t protected by the Voting Rights Act. The VRA only protects voters in districts with large numbers of speakers of a single language. No large numbers? No legal requirement to translate voting materials, which means no access to your rights if you aren't literate in and comfortable speaking English. And because Asian Americans don't speak one big language called 'Asian,' our fastest-growing communities face massive barriers to their right to vote. And democracy should be be accessible in every language.

77% of eligible Asian American voters say they would use in-language tools, if they could get them, when they cast a ballot. 45% of precincts required by law to provide translated materials don’t. It’s clear that there is a critical translation need that isn’t provided by existing laws, systems, and infrastructure.

We're ready to solve this problem. For the past three years, 18MR has been a key supernode in a network of creative, tech-savvy, and passionate individuals and organizations who understand the untapped potential of the AAPI electorate. We have won major campaigns targeting corporations and government figures with a team you can count on one hand through the collective power of this network.

In addition to the organizing going on in our networks, we are also working on partnerships with groups already solving some of the most challenging technical and legal questions that face VoterVOX. Our partnership with Long Distance Voter, the most popular source for vote-by-mail information online, means we can integrate their cutting-edge ballot ordering technology. Our emerging partnership with Meedan, creators of the Bridge microtranslation app, means we can harness the power of the crowd--and its varied skill level with translation--to deliver VoterVOX in more languages for more users, and provide more robust interpretation resources for volunteers, by working with their API and out-of-the-box toolset.

Building community power through smart tech and good organizing has always been central to our mission. VoterVOX is a major building block of developing longer term wins through voting--but not limited to voting. Integrated with our ongoing programmatic work in advocacy and organizing, the voters and volunteers we engage through VoterVOX hold the potential to be a powerful network for transformative change.
