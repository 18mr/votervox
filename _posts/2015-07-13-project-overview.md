blurb: "VoterVOX is part smartphone app, part volunteer work, and 100% civic-minded. It’s designed to empower millions of Asian Pacific Americans who aren’t exercising their rights to vote because they aren’t comfortable in English and aren’t protected by the Voting Rights Act. The VRA only protects voters in districts with large numbers of speakers of a single language. No large numbers? No legal requirement to translate voting materials, which means no access to your rights if you aren't literate in and comfortable speaking English. And because Asian Americans don't speak one big language called 'Asian,' our fastest-growing communities face massive barriers to their right to vote. And democracy should be be accessible in every language."

VoterVOX is part smartphone app, part volunteer work, and 100% civic-minded. It’s designed to empower millions of Asian Pacific Americans who aren’t exercising their rights to vote because they aren’t comfortable speaking English and aren’t protected by the Voting Rights Act. The VRA only protects voters in districts with large numbers of speakers of a single language. No large numbers? No legal requirement to translate voting materials, which means no access to your rights if you aren't literate in and comfortable speaking English. And because Asian Americans don't speak one big language called 'Asian,' our fastest-growing communities face massive barriers to their right to vote. And democracy should be be accessible in every language.

77% of eligible Asian American voters say they would use in-language tools, if they could get them, when they cast a ballot. 45% of precincts required by law to provide translated materials don’t. It’s clear that there is a critical translation need that isn’t provided by existing laws, systems, and infrastructure.

Building community power through smart tech and good organizing has always been central to our mission. VoterVOX is a major building block of developing longer term wins through voting--but not limited to voting. Integrated with our ongoing programmatic work in advocacy and organizing, the voters and volunteers we engage through VoterVOX hold the potential to be a powerful network for change. We are excited to be the first U.S.-based online advocacy organization to design and build a mobile app to connect with our members.
