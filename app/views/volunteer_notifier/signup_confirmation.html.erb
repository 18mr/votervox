Hi <%= @firstname %>,<br/><br/>

We’re so glad you’re volunteering with us!<br/><br/>

Before you can get matched, please get oriented by watching this video. At the end, you’ll be quizzed on your knowledge, and then a VoterVOX administrator will approve you to start meeting with voters.<br/><br/>

After that, we’ll give you some voter matches to accept or decline. We’ll then connect you with the ones that also accept you as their translator, too, and the two of you can communicate directly to set up a meeting where you can help them with their questions about the ballot.<br/><br/>

All the best,<br/>
The VoterVOX Team
